    <h2>May 5, 2019</h2>
  <p>i want to write music, right?
  i want to write poetry, right?
  in a way, the internet has scourged my voice, non-sequiturs, comedy, irony, in short blips, if it makes people laugh, cool, i’ve trained for years to make people laugh.</p>

<p>  i’ve been torn apart, re-stuffed, shattered, re-mended, loved tenderly, un-loved, dozens of times
  how do i train for that?
  i’m an artist, i draw titties, i draw comics, i make t-shirts, i make people laugh
  laughter is valuable, but at this point, for whom?
  making people happy makes me happy, it makes me loved, which makes me happy
  but when i’m not happy, what then?
  i’m an artist, i’m intelligent, i think? maybe in my teens, maybe the funnies have rot my brain since then
  i have lots of words that float around in my head, a lot of burning, flesh-rotting words, head-smashing words, skin-cutting words, that show themselves through my actions
  like a caveman, almost, i suppose? bad word in brain. don’t know how move mouth. hurt self. unga bunga.</p>

  <p>i am kept up at night by the spectre of my own body
  i balloon, into a pink, translucent, slab of meat
  with a stench of something left in the sun for days
  the horror, the horror
  one I must live with until the end of time</p>

  <p>you ever realize that the words that you type are art in and of itself
  and that even if they feel meaningless, that the words that you type
  are an emblem of a thought you’ve had in the past
  and when you struggle to understand
  comprehend, even
  your own sense of being
  you can look back and realize that you have a presence
  in the shape of a google doc on your school laptop</p>

  <p>if I can be king, then why do I hide a screaming infant within the cavern of my ribcage?
  if i can be king, then why do I sit, paralyzed in fear
  scared I will forget everything I am capable of?
  do I want to be king?</p>
